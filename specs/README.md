# Specs of ayr
*Todo: Formatting of sections, expand once more things implemented*

What follows is an in-depth look at the specs of the `ayr` array language, so any individual can gain knowledge of how the language works.

## Array Model
`ayr` uses the based array model, similar to [BQN](https://github.com/mlochbaum/BQN/blob/master/doc/based.md). Values can be scalars, vectors, or matrices. These correspond to rank 0, 1, and 2 data respectively. 
<br>*Note: higher rank data will be supported in the future*

### Examples
```
    <2 3 6
[ 2 3 6 ]
    1
1
    1 2 3 ; _4 5 11
 1  2  3
-4  5 11
```

## Basic syntax
General types come in the form of signed floats and strings, which may or may not be scalar values. A vector, similar to **APL**, is denoted with a series of these general values separated by spaces. To create a matrix, you can currently use `;` to separate vectors or grouping (`()`) similar to how APL generally does it. Note that `;` is not a symbolâ€”rather, it is used solely for matrix denotion

Incomplete operations within groups **or** assigned to a variable are called [Trains](#trains).

Binders are left-assosciative, while symbols are right-assosciative.

### Examples
```
    13
13
    'hello'
hello
    _4 'hello' ; 1 2
[ -4 ] [ hello ] 
 [ 1 ]     [ 2 ]
```
*The way output is stylized is implementation dependant*

A symbol refers to a built in ascii symbol that denotes a monadic/dyadic operation. A binder refers to a symbol that monadically and/or dyadically takes a symbol on does something with them. For example, take the `+` (add) symbol, `-` (subtract/negate) symbol, `>` (first) symbol, and the `&` (atop) binder

### Examples
```
    1 2 + 3
4 5
    > 1 2 3
1
    1 2 3 -&+ 4 5 6
-5 -7 -9
```

## User Functions
User functions refer to, as the name implies, functions defined by the user. For instance,
```
    add: +
    4 add 5
9
```
They are defined with the syntax `<name> : <expression>`

## Trains
*Key: lowercase letters represent symbols and uppercase represent immediates*

```
(f g) A          -> f g A
A (f g) B        -> A f g B
(A f) B          -> A f B
(f g h) A        -> (f A) g h A
A (f g h) B      -> (A f B) g A h B
(f g h i) A      -> f (g A) h i A
..etc
```
Note that this is not an exhaustive list, there may be some edge cases not included.
